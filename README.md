This is a multiplayer game where the active player rolls the dice, and their dice count is added to their current score. If the player holds the score, it is added to their total score, and the player toggles. Otherwise, if he chooses to go ahead and gets one at the dice, he loses his current score, and the player changes. The player with the highest total score is the winner.
